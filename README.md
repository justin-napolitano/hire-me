# hire-me

An irreverent-but-useful hiring one-pager built with Astro + Tailwind. Same playful chassis as the dating profile landing page, but tuned for recruiters, hiring managers, and collaborators who want the receipts fast.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:4321/ to preview the site.

## Customize

- Update contact + case-study links, metrics, and references in `src/config/profile.ts`.
- Swap icons or add new CTAs in `public/icons/`.
- Adjust colors/typography in `src/styles/global.css` if you want a different palette.

## Deploy

Same as any Astro project—Vercel, Netlify, etc. Ship the dist folder or hook it straight to a platform.
